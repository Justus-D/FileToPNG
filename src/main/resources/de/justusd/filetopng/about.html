    <b>FileToPNG</b>: Save files in PNG images<br>
    Copyright &copy; 2024, Justus Dietrich<br>
    https://github.com/Justus-D/FileToPNG
</p>
<p>
    This application can write the contents of a file into a PNG image.
    It can also retrieve the written data later on. A hash is being
    calculated while writing data to a PNG. This ensures that possible
    corruption of the data can be detected when restoring the data from
    one or more PNGs. There is no limit for the file size of a stored
    file. Each generated PNG can hold up to 1 200 000 000 bytes. After
    that, a new PNG is used to store further data. Each generated PNG
    has a file name in the format
    "<code>YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm-ss_part&lt;index&gt;.png</code>".
    If you want to recover the data stored in a generated PNG, you need
    to select the folder in which the generated PNG files are stored.
    If there is more than one PNG file which stores a file, the first
    one will be selected for recovery.

<h3>Open-Source Libraries</h3>
<p>
    This application uses a couple of open-source libraries. Without them,
    this application would not be able to work. Here are some of the most
    important ones.
